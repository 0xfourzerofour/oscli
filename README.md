### OSCLI - Real time audio visualisation using WGPU

The implementation is quite simple right now, however I will be planning on continuing the project to visualise the frequency spectrum as well. 

The current implementation only works with mp3 files using [I'm an inline-style link](https://github.com/germangb/minimp3-rs)

# Instructions

```
cargo run --release

```

drag your mp3 file into the window.

# controls

spacebar - play
p - pause
up arrow - skip 1 second
